# Minor-Project-DEEP-FAKE-DECODER--AI-FOR-DETECTING-DEEPFAKE-VOICE-SCAMS-
DeepFakeDecoder is a hybrid deep learning model designed to detect synthetic (AI-generated) voices with high accuracy. This project combines spectrogram-based visual analysis, temporal and spectral audio features (like MFCCs), and metadata to effectively distinguish real human speech from deepfake audio.
